# Flight Management System

## About the Project
The Flight Management System is designed to handle various tasks within a flight operation, including user login, flight details, and more. The application features a user-friendly interface with Java Swing, connecting to a PostgreSQL database for storing and retrieving data.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core programming language used for the backend.
- **Java Swing**: Used for creating a graphical user interface (GUI).
- **PostgreSQL**: Database management system for data storage and retrieval.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Supports different login types for varied access levels.
- **Interactive GUI**: Responsive and easy-to-navigate interface.
- **Database Integration**: Connects to PostgreSQL for secure data handling.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Install **Java Development Kit (JDK)**.
- Install **PostgreSQL**.
- Set up a PostgreSQL database with the necessary tables for the application.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FlightManagementSystem.git
   ```
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
3. Configure the PostgreSQL database connection in the source code.

### Database Setup
Set up the PostgreSQL database and add the necessary tables and schema as required by the application. Hereâ€™s an example schema for user authentication:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE users (
       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
       password VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
       role VARCHAR(20)
   );
   ```

Update the SQL queries and configuration in your Java code to match your setup.

## Usage
1. Run the application by executing the `MainScreen` class.
2. Use the provided options in the application to select login type and manage flight details.
